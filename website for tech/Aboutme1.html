            Hello my name is Andy Osegueda and I'm a 21 year old college student at Kean University. This is my fourth year
            at Kean University. I was born in brooklyn, but I currently live in Westfield, New Jersey. I speak three langauges which are English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before taking
            this class I had no previous experience working with html. After building this simple website I plan on adding more content as
            I go in the future. I also have some experience working with java, python, and C+ and plan to work with more computer langauges in
            the future. Some of the things that I do in my free time are playing video games or watching sports. I'm an avid soccer fan and I
            support Chelsea football club. I have been supporting this team since I was ten years old and dont plan on stopping any time soon.
            As for other sports my other favorite sport would be American football and I support the New York Giants. Some of my other interests
            involve shoes and clothes which I spend a lot of money on. So thats a little bit about me 
            and some of my experiences as well as some of my interests.
